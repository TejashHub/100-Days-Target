<!-- float and double differrence -->

# Precision

Float :

It is a 32-bit (4-byte) data type and provides up to 6-7 decimal places of precision.

In your example, float n1 = 3.14f;, the value 3.14 is stored with limited precision.

Double:

It is a 64-bit (8-byte) data type and provides up to 15-16 decimal places of precision.

In your example, double n2 = 3.14159265359;, the value is stored with much higher precision.

# Memory

Float :

uses 4 bytes of memory.

Double :

uses 8 bytes of memory.

Range :

float has a smaller range of values compared to double
